# Prosthesis
A Prosthetic Hand for Your Friend or Family.

### **Step-by-Step Manufacturing Process for the Prosthetic Arm**

This guide outlines the entire process, from conceptualization to final assembly, ensuring functionality, durability, and user comfort.

### **1. Design Phase**

#### **Step 1: Anatomical Measurements**
- Use **3D scanning** or manual measurement to capture the user’s forearm dimensions, wrist shape, and residual limb structure.
- Identify the precise locations of **flexor and extensor muscles** (e.g., flexor digitorum and extensor digitorum) for placing EMG sensors.

#### **Step 2: Digital Modeling**
- Create a **3D CAD model** of the prosthesis using software like SolidWorks or Fusion 360:
  - **Over Section:** Encases the top of the forearm and houses the motors, actuators, and battery.
  - **Under Section:** Wraps under the forearm and secures the EMG sensors for muscle signal detection.
  - Include hollow channels for synthetic tendons, wiring, and actuation mechanisms.
  - Design modular, articulated fingers with joints to mimic natural hand movement.

#### **Step 3: Material Selection**
- Choose lightweight, durable materials:
  - **Prosthetic Shell:** Nylon (PA12) or carbon fiber-reinforced polymer.
  - **Finger Components:** TPU (flexible thermoplastic polyurethane) or reinforced ABS.
  - **Synthetic Tendons:** High-tensile-strength polymer or Kevlar-coated fiber.
  - **Electronics Housing:** Waterproof, shock-resistant polymer.

### **2. Prototyping Phase**

#### **Step 4: 3D Printing**
- Use **SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)** or **FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)** for component fabrication:
  - Print the prosthetic shell, finger modules, and internal channels separately for modular assembly.
  - Ensure fine tolerances for moving parts like joints and tendon channels.

#### **Step 5: EMG Circuit Prototyping**
- Assemble an **EMG sensor system**:
  - Use medical-grade EMG pads to detect muscle activity.
  - Connect sensors to a **microcontroller** (e.g., Arduino Nano, ESP32) for signal processing.
- Develop and test firmware to translate muscle signals into motor commands.

#### **Step 6: Actuator and Motor Testing**
- Test **servo motors** or **micro linear actuators** to ensure they generate sufficient torque for finger movement:
  - Configure for pulling synthetic tendons to mimic flexion and extension.
  - Ensure smooth, proportional response to EMG signals.

### **3. Assembly Phase**

#### **Step 7: Mounting EMG Sensors**
- Install **EMG sensors** along the identified muscle activation points:
  - Use adjustable pads for secure placement and optimal signal detection.
  - Route sensor wiring through internal prosthetic channels to avoid tangling or damage.

#### **Step 8: Installing Motors and Tendons**
- **Motor Mounting:**
  - Secure motors in the **over section** of the prosthesis with vibration-dampening brackets.
- **Tendon Routing:**
  - Thread synthetic tendons through channels in the prosthetic fingers.
  - Attach tendons to motor spools for controlled flexion and extension.
  - Include tension-adjustment mechanisms for fine-tuning.

#### **Step 9: Battery and USB-C Integration**
- **Battery Installation:**
  - Mount a rechargeable **lithium-ion battery** (2000–3000 mAh) in a protected compartment.
  - Ensure thermal regulation and shock resistance.
- **USB-C Port Setup:**
  - Incorporate a **retractable USB-C charging cable**:
    - Use a spring-loaded mechanism for smooth extension and retraction.
    - Protect the cable with durable, flexible materials like reinforced silicone or TPU.
    - Integrate a **tuck-away compartment** to store the USB-C extension securely when not in use.

### **4. Final Assembly**

#### **Step 10: Finger Mechanism Assembly**
- Assemble finger segments using **pivot joints**:
  - Use **metal pins** or durable nylon hinges for joint articulation.
  - Install elastic bands or springs at each joint to assist in finger extension.

#### **Step 11: Wiring and Electronics Integration**
- Connect all components:
  - Route wiring for the EMG sensors, motors, and battery through internal channels.
  - Ensure secure connections and waterproofing for electrical components.

#### **Step 12: Haptic Feedback (Optional)**
- Install **small vibration motors** to provide tactile feedback for actions like gripping or releasing objects.

#### **Step 13: External Finish**
- Sand and polish 3D-printed surfaces for a smooth, professional appearance.
- Apply a **protective coating** to ensure durability and resistance to wear.

### **5. Testing and Calibration Phase**

#### **Step 14: Functional Testing**
- Test the prosthesis under real-world conditions:
  - Verify smooth, proportional finger movement in response to muscle signals.
  - Evaluate grip strength and responsiveness for various objects.

#### **Step 15: User Adjustment and Training**
- Fit the prosthesis to the user and adjust the tension of synthetic tendons.
- Train the user on using EMG signals to control the prosthetic hand effectively.

#### **Step 16: Final Quality Checks**
- Perform durability tests for all mechanical and electrical components.
- Ensure the battery system meets safety and longevity standards.
